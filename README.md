	Name: ParticlesPack4
	Version: 0.1.0
	Type: GameObject Plugin
	Author: Kiwi.js Team
	Website: www.kiwijs.org
	KiwiJS last version tested: 1.4.0

## Alpha Notice

This pack is still under development. However, the sprites themselves are already used by the [Particle Editor](http://tools.kiwijs.org/particle-editor/), so we're making the pack available. Expect later versions to add a number of preconfigured particles ready for use in your game.

Right now, you'll have to configure your own particles, or use the Editor. Let us know if you do anything exciting at [www.kiwijs.org](http://www.kiwijs.org/)!

## Description

The Colossal Particle Pack plugin comes with a bunch of preconfigured particle effects to add to your game. Includes 18 sprites.

This plugin requires the ParticlesGL plugin, which is included with the pack.
